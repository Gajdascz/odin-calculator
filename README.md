# Capabilities 
* Can perform the following functions: Additon, Subtraction, Multiplication, Divison, Exponentiation, Percentage, Modulo, and Factorial.
* Can perform the following actions: All Clear - Clears all working memory, Back - Removes the last digit / input.
* Allows decimals and restricts numbers to having only one. For example, you cannot input 1.1.1+2.
* Allows user input by clicking the buttons as well as keyboard keys.
* Dynamically changes text size and eventually limits input based on number of characters that can be displayed to prevent text overflow.
* Keeps track of the active working number to allow chaining of calculations. For example, entering 2+2 returns 4 and allows you to continue working with the resulting 4.

# To Be Implemented
* Fix bug(s) where operators stay disabled when first input is an operator and user deletes it using back. Use AC (all clear) to fix for now.
* Parentheses.
* Fix hover effect from showing when button is disabled.
